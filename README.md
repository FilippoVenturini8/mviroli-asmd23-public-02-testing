## Task 1 : Reorganise

Experimented `Mockito` features by implementing `Unit Testing` of the `StandardDevice` class with a TDD approach.

Reorganised the tests already implemented and written now ones, using all the types of **Test Doubles** available such as `Dummy`, `Stub`, `Mock` and `Spy`.

All the tests implemented can be found in the following file: *"reorganized/ReorganizedDeviceTests.java"*.
